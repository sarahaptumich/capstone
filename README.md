# Settle it in the Cypher - Breakdancing Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains our Capstone for the Masterâ€™s in Applied Data Science from the University of Michigan. Our project aimed to conduct analysis on the breakdancing competition data provided by "Settle it in the Cypher" and share our insights to further the knowledge in breakdancing.

## Team Members
- Sara Haptonstall (sarahapt@umich.edu)
- Sihyun Kyung (skyfront@umich.edu)
- Sabrina Mahnke (smahnke@umich.edu)

## Installation
### Auxiliary files to run the following notebooks are in the files folder download the folder  and unzip the files:
- Brace_Angles_Analysis.ipynb
- Brace_Classifier_Hyperparameter.ipynb
- Brace_Dance_Classifier.ipynb
- SIC_Ranking_System.ipynb
- SIC_Scoring_Sys_Analysis.ipynb
- Tensor_Board.ipynb
  
### For the folowing notebooks specific files are in this github
- Video_Analysis_Dance_Duration.ipynb
- data_exploration_judges(fatique).ipynb
- data_exploration_judges(judge_bias).ipynb
- data_exploration_judges(profiles).ipynb
- data_exploration_judges3(normalized_winner).ipynb

### All files for the website (Streamlit App) are in the website_creation folder.



## Prerequisites
```bash
# Example for Python projects
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
In addition to the notebooks in this repository, we have an interactive application that can be found [here](<https://teambreakers.streamlit.app/>).

## Features
Our project includes a variety of analyses and features:
- Scoring System Comparison
- Breakdancer Ranking
- Judges Profile
- Judge Bias
- Score Normalization
- Video Analysis
- Dance Movement Prediction

## Acknowledgments
We thank "Settle In the Cypher" for allowing the use of their data for analysis and for their expert advice during our research.
